# About Me 
My name is Carly Armour. I am currently a doctoral student in the Educational Policy & Leadership Studies - Higher Education program at the University of Iowa. I love to learn and feel that coding will give me more skills to be a better employee in our society. I hope to apply what I learn to increase inclusion and accessibility for everyone, especially minoritized and disadvantaged populations.
