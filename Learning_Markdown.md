# So...What is Markdown? 
Markdown is a lightweight markup language for generating html files. 

# If your response is "Say what?" 
In layman's terms, Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. 
It allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)
