# Markdown

So...What is Markdown? It is a lightweight markup language for generating html files.  If your response is: **"Say what?"**, no worries! In layman's terms, Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. It allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)

# GitHub

What is GitHub? [GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online platform that provides simple assistance with creating webpages. You are able to create Markdown documents on Github.

## Syntax

What is Syntax in Computer Progamming/Coding? Syntax is the set of rules that define what the various combinations of symbols mean. This tells the computer how to read the code. Syntax refers to a concept in writing code dealing with a very specific set of words and a very specific order to those words when we give the computer instructions.
