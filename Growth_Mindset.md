# Growth Mindset
Having a _growth mindset_ means that I can learn new skills or improve on existing skills with effort, patience, and much practice (to build muscle memory!). 

## Staying Committed to a Growth Mindset
1. Remembering that roadblocks are **normal** and a way to stretch and grow. 
2. Having a positive attitude when challenges arise versus giving up. 
3. Receiving feedback as constructive and making adjustments.
