# Operators and Loops

## What are [operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)? 
JavaScript includes operators same as other languages. An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result. For example, in `1 + 2`, the `+` sign is an operator and 1 is left side operand and 2 is right side operand. The `+` operator performs the addition of two numeric values and returns a result.

**JavaScript includes following categories of operators.**

  - Arithmetic Operators
  - Comparison Operators
  - Logical Operators
  - Assignment Operators
  - Conditional Operators
  - Ternary Operator

## What are [loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)? 
Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 

### `for` loop
**The `for` loop requires following three parts.**
  - Initializer: Initialize a counter variable to start with
  - Condition: specify a condition that must evaluate to true for next iteration
  - Iteration: increase or decrease counter

To provide clarity, a `for` loop is as follows:

> `for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])`
> 
>   `statement`

where `initialExpression` is executed, `conditionExpression` is evaluated, and if `true` the `statement` part is executed. This repeats until evaluating `conditionExpression` returns false upon which the loop terminates.

### `while` loop
JavaScript includes `while` loop to execute code repeatedly till it satisfies a specified condition. Unlike `for` loop, `while` loop only requires *condition expression*.

A `while` loop is as follows:

> `while (condition)`
> 
>   `statement`

where `condition` is evaluated, and if `true`, `statement` is executed and `condition` is evaluated again. This repeats until there is a return of `false` for the `condition` evaluation.
