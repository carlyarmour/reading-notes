# Building HTML Strucure for Web Pages

- HTML, short for "HyperText Markup Language", is a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on web pages.
- Content is wrapped (or marked-up) in "tags" (a.k.a. elements).
- HTML creates a Hierarchy
- HTML allows content to be displayed in blocks or boxes
- ***Note:*** _It's best practice in the coding industry to use lowercase characters in HTML._

## HMTL Tags

- Tags surround the _content_ they describe. For example:
    > `<p>We're discussing HTML tags today.</p>`

- Most have _opening_ tags: `<p>` and _closing_ tags: `</p>`.
- Tags tell the browser _what_ the content is:
  - Paragraph text `<p>...</p>`
  - Headings `<h1>...</h1>`
  - Navigation `<nav>...</nav>`
  - Article `<article>...</article>`
  - Footer `<footer>...</footer>`
- Tags help organize the content. For example:
   > ![Example of HTML structure](/HTML_example.jpg)

# Wireframing
 Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers to allow them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. The process itself is very multi-disciplinary and user-focused.

**Here are some helpul wireframing notes:**
- When designing for the screen you need to know where all the information is going to go in plain black and white diagrams before building anything with code—whether that’s a developer coding it, or you the designer.
- Without the distractions of colors, typeface choices or text, wireframing lets you plan the layout and interaction of your interface.
- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
- Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.
